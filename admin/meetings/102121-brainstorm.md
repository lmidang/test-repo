    Kick in the Kitchen [tentative]:
    
    - Pepper system where you unlock recipes by completing increasingly spicier recipes
    - You can search previously unlocked recipes based on spice
        - Most thumbed up recipes show first
    - Unlocked spice levels can give you a user level such as Jalapeno Joe
    - Locked and unlocked recipes separate to prevent not being allowed to cook desired spice level
    - Pairing system with spice, x recipe needs some milk, y recipe needs vanilla ice cream
    - Spicy challenge, create daily recipes of increasing spice
