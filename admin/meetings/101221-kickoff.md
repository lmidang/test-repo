    Group Contract
    
    - Primary Means of Communication: Agree that we should always communicate, esp if we need help. Don't leave it to the last minute to ask for help. Slack as primary means of asynchronous communication. Everyone needs to react to #announcement messages within 24 hours. Zoom for online meetings.
    - Meetings: In person after class meeting Tuesday weekly.  In-person stand-ups Tuesday and Thursday after class, those who can't make it are expected to send an update over slack by the end of the day 11:59pm. Weekend informal zoom meetings for people who want to work together and need help.
    - General Responsibility: Everyone needs to be responsive in their subteams, let everyone know if they can't make it to a meeting, respect one another. If someone doesn't know how to do something, be willing to help them if you can.
    - Conflict Resolution: Deal within subteam and then if it gets worse, get the leaders involved. If it gets even worse, get the TA's
    - Expectation of Faculty and GTA: Be responsive and give guidance when asked for. We will use Slack responsibly and not spam the faculty or TA.
