### Meeting Minutes

Features we liked

- Compiled 5 things we liked
- Ratings, checkboxes, etc
- A good idea to assess what features we need is rate by difficulty and by priority

Reassessing the plan for the project

- The bare minimum of the project
    - Create a recipe
    - Search a recipe
    - Edit/Delete recipes
- **Decision:** We should think of the user profiles first - do something more niche
    - Narrow the scope
    - This will help us figure out what features we want to add (want for this week)
- **Assign to everyone: Come up with very niche user profiles and go through a step by step what they'd do if they go through the app (Due before Thursday's meeting)**

### Requires Further Discussion

- Decide on subteams (later date TBA)
- User profiles
