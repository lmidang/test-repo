### Meeting Minutes

Going over fat-marker sketches

- User input: we don't want to overcrowd the recipe with the description at the beginning
- Editing recipe and recipe page should probably go hand in hand
    - Ingredients should be entered in a way to easily convert metric/US and change serving size
- Editing profile and profile display might want to work together
- Further pages:
    - Settings page for users

TODO Before Tuesday

- Redo the user profiles for the spicy topic idea
- Features for the assigned page and flow diagram of how it'll interact with other pages
- **Person In Charge: Everyone**

### Requires Further Discussion

- Feature diagrams
- Further discussion on the wireframes and designs
