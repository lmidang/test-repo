### Team Communication

It is agreed that every member should be committed to communicating with the team or respective leads throughout the duration of this quarter. Team members will communicate through the decided means of appropriate Slack channels and DMs. Emails may be utilized in the event that a member is unresponsive for an extended period of time on Slack. 

Due to the nature of our project timeline, it is imperative that team members stay up to date with progress. Thus, it has been agreed that team members must react to messages in the *#announcements* Slack channel within 24 hours to signify that they are current with all urgent developments.

In the event that a member feels overwhelmed or recognizes that they will need support in a task, it is agreed that they will clearly communicate their situation and request assistance to the team as soon as possible.

### Team Meetings

Team meetings will be held weekly on Tuesdays after class to discuss development goals for the week. Furthermore, stands ups with be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays after class to share progress, identify areas of focus, and facilitate individual accountability. In the event that a member is unable to make a stand up meeting, it is agreed that they must provide a written Slack update for the team by the end of the day. Meetings and stand up will have a tentative overview provided at the beginning by the meeting lead for time intentionality and organizational smoothness. Meeting frequencies and times may be adjusted by team leads to reflect appropriate stage of project timeline. Meeting notes will be *recorded and posted* the group repository in a timely manner.

- **Team Meeting** (Tues)
- **Stand Up** (Tues & Thurs)

### Team Member Responsibilities

It is agreed that every team member will be reasonably responsive in their sub teams and to the group as a whole. In the event that a member communicates reasonably ahead of time that they **must** miss a meeting, group members should respect their schedule.

It is agreed that the group as a whole is responsible for the overall progress and success of the team. If a team member asks for assistance or does not know how to perform a task, other team members should be willing to help them if possible.

Furthermore, it is agreed that team members will exhibit the following values:

- Humility, Respect, and Trust
- Honestly about mistakes or confusion
- Group accountability
- Inclusiveness
- General courtesy
- Academic integrity

### Conflict Resolution

In the event that there is a conflict between members, it is agreed that they should try to communicate with each other and attempt to resolve any discord that may arise. If a party does not feel comfortable with direct communication or if no resolution can be made, it is agreed that the sub team leader then team leads should be informed accordingly. In the event that the situation can not be resolved by the team leads, it is agreed that the team advisor will be contacted and involved.

It is agreed that group shaming or spreading of rumors to deal with a conflict between members will absolutely not be tolerated.
