# Database Decision

* Status: Accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Everyone
* Date: October 28, 2021 <!-- optional -->


## Context and Problem Statement

We were unsure on how to go about implementing the database for our project. In order to have functionalities like user logins and 
sharing of recipes between users, we were originally thinking on using a third-party server host like FireBase. 

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* How do we implement functionalities like user logins and recipe sharing?
* Who would research how to use FireBase and teach it to everyone else?
* How much would the service cost?

## Considered Options

* Go ahead with using FireBase
* Switch to a fully local database

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Local database, because we figured that this was the most feasible option given the extremely short time window. 

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Made the project a lot more feasible
* Made the team much more confident towards completing the project
* Saves us time spent researching the online database

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We had to scrap a lot of our planned features
* The time we already spent researching online databases was wasted
