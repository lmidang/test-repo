# SPA Decision

* Status: Accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Everyone
* Date: November 4, 2021 <!-- optional -->


## Context and Problem Statement

After Lorenzo completed the lab, he pitched the idea that we should focus on making our app a single page application. He argued that if we do so, 
we would make our app run faster and simplify the development of the app.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* How do we make our app fast?
* How will transitioning between different pages work on our app?

## Considered Options

* Develop a multi-page web application
* Develop a single-page web application

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Single-page application, because that would simplify the backend interactions between different screens on the user's end. 
We could also load all of the recipe cards at the start of the app, which would lengthen the time when users open the app, but would make every other 
interaction much quicker.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Makes the implementation simpler since we can use previous labs as a guide
* Makes our app run faster during user interaction

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* If we're not careful, we could stuff all of our front end code onto one or two files, making development really messy
* Loading all of the assets will make loading upon the user opening the app much longer
